    <meta name="description" content="This AI-based Trip Planner website helps users plan city-wise travel itineraries based on their preferences and number of days. Users select a city, choose the type of places they like (such as historical sites, temples, nature, or beaches), and specify trip duration. The system then generates a day-wise travel plan along with famous local foods and visual map representation. The current version is a prototype using AI-generated suggestions and static data for demonstration. For real-time accurate place recommendations and maps, future enhancements will include integration with live location and map APIs.">
